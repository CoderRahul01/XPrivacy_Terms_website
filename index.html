    <!-- Chosen Palette: Refined Slate & Subtle Amber -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A two-column layout is used for clarity on larger screens. A fixed sidebar contains navigation links that scroll to the corresponding sections in the main content area. This makes the dense legal text easy to navigate. A search bar is included for keyword highlighting, allowing users to find specific terms quickly. The structure is designed to make a static, text-heavy document feel like an interactive tool, improving usability and comprehension. On mobile, the layout stacks vertically for readability. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Since the source report is entirely textual, traditional data visualizations are not applicable. The primary goal is to make the text itself more explorable. 
        - Report Info: Full text of Terms of Service. -> Goal: Improve Navigation & Searchability. -> Presentation: A clickable sidebar list and a main content area. -> Interaction: Clicking links smoothly scrolls to sections; typing in a search bar highlights all instances of the term in the document. -> Justification: This directly addresses the user need to locate information within a long legal document. -> Library/Method: Vanilla JS for interactions, TailwindCSS for layout.
        - Report Info: Key concepts from the ToS. -> Goal: Inform/Summarize. -> Presentation: A "Key Points" section at the top with subtle icons and concise text. -> Interaction: Static display. -> Justification: Provides a high-level overview before the user dives into the full text, improving accessibility and quick understanding. -> Library/Method: HTML & TailwindCSS. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
